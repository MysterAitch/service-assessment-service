## Use GitHub Issues and Projects to manage and record our work

### Options

- Azure DevOps (ADO)
- GitHub
- Other (Trello?)

**Working in the open**:

- This includes managing and recording our past/current/upcoming work in the open.
- If using ADO, this would be hidden behind a login to ADO.
- If using GitHub, this would be visible to all.
- Using GitHub allows anybody with an interest to see what we are working on, and to contribute to the discussion.
- Using GitHub allows anybody to potentially work on and submit a pull request to our codebase 
  - e.g., perhaps another department has some time/resource available to implement a feature
  - e.g., perhaps a DfE colleague has some personal/professional time available and want to contribute to a "good first issue"
  - (none of this is possible if using ADO)

### Decision

We will use GitHub Issues and Projects to manage and record our work.
